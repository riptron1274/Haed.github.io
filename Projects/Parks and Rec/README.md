# SQL Analysis Project — Parks & Recreation Dataset

## Overview
This project demonstrates end-to-end SQL skills using a fictional
Parks & Recreation employee dataset. The database was designed and
populated from scratch and used to perform analytical queries that
mirror real-world HR and organizational analysis tasks.

The goal of the project is to showcase practical SQL proficiency,
from basic querying to advanced database concepts.

## Dataset
The database consists of three main tables:

- **employee_demographics**  
  Employee age, gender, and birth date

- **employee_salary**  
  Job roles, salaries, and department assignments

- **parks_departments**  
  Organizational department structure

All data was manually created to simulate realistic organizational data.
